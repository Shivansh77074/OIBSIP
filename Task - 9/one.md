Patching SQL Injection Vulnerability in DVWA
Introduction
SQL Injection is one of the most dangerous and common web application vulnerabilities. In this document, we will explain how to patch a basic SQL Injection vulnerability found in the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) under the SQL Injection (Low) module.
Problem Overview
The 'User ID' input in DVWA's SQL Injection module allows direct injection of user-controlled data into SQL queries.
Vulnerable SQL Query:
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = '$id';
Exploit Payload:
1 OR 1=1 -- -
Patch Strategy
To mitigate SQL Injection, developers should adopt secure coding practices and defense-in-depth strategies as explained below.
1. Use Prepared Statements / Parameterized Queries
Prepared statements separate the SQL logic from user input. This prevents malicious input from being interpreted as SQL commands.
Secure PHP Example (PDO):
$id = $_GET['id'];
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->execute([$id]);
$data = $stmt->fetchAll();
Secure PHP Example (MySQLi):
$id = $_GET['id'];
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("i", $id);
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
2. Input Validation and Sanitization
Always validate user input to ensure it matches expected data types. For example, only integers should be accepted for ID fields.
PHP Example:
$id = filter_input(INPUT_GET, 'id', FILTER_VALIDATE_INT);
3. Use Stored Procedures
Stored procedures keep SQL logic on the database side, minimizing exposure of dynamic queries.
Example:
CREATE PROCEDURE getUserById(IN userId INT)
BEGIN
  SELECT first_name, last_name FROM users WHERE id = userId;
END;
Principle of Least Privilege
Ensure the database user account only has permissions it needs.
- Don't use root or admin-level accounts.
- Only allow SELECT access where necessary.
Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Use tools like ModSecurity, AWS WAF, or Cloudflare to detect and block malicious SQL patterns at the application perimeter.
Summary 
Vulnerability	Solution
Raw SQL Queries	Use Prepared Statements
No Input Filtering	Validate and Sanitize Input
Overprivileged Accounts	Enforce Least Privilege
Direct SQL Access	Use Stored Procedures
No Application Filtering	Add a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Conclusion
SQL Injection vulnerabilities can compromise an entire database if left unpatched. By implementing secure coding practices, database-level protection, and application firewalls, developers can ensure their applications are resistant to these attacks.

Securing user inputs and avoiding dynamic SQL queries is not just a best practiceâ€”it's essential for safeguarding user data and maintaining application integrity.
